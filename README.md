# RawData
This is my group submission of the "RawData" course exam project from RUC (Roskilde University).
A description of the course can be found in MainCourseDescription.pdf and a description of the project can be found in CourseDescription.pdf

In this project we design a schema for a PostgreSQL database, build a restfull API in C#, and a simple website in javascript, to display and make notes for a stackoverflow dump.
